## What about Swift?
One of the biggest questions I get about the book is when will there be a Swift version? There are currently no plans for a Swift version of the book, but I have started porting the book's sample code to Swift 2.0. There's no specific date for when this will be complete, but if you want to follow along, the repo can be found here:
